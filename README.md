##Loops and Conditionals
######Boolean logic
comparison operators: _>, >=, <, <=, ==, !=, ===, !==_
== operator performs type coercion
The === operator is more specific and encouraged to use in comparisons

Logical operators: _&&, ||, !_

######Conditionals

If, Else if, if

```
	for (let i = -10; i <= 19; i++) {
  		console.log(i);
	}
```
