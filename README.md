#Overview
This is calculator with basic numerical, algebraic functions and scientific features. The scientific functions occupy the top most rows and the left hand side of the calculator. The numbers and algebraic functions take the right hand side.

The black and white theme has been carefully considered for visibility and clarity

#Numbers
The numbers go from 0 to 9 and are given a bold typeface to standout because all functions are performed on them.

#Algebraic Functions
These are functions that are defined using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers, and roots.
+ is the addition function
- is the subtraction function
* is the multiplication function
/ is the division function
x^ is the powers function
√ is the roots function

#Trigonometric functions
These are functions which relate to angles
sin, cos, tan will measure the ratio of sides of a right angled triangle

#Parentheses
() These are useful in scientific notations or formulas with geometric components

#Squaring function
x ² will multiply the given value twice

#Conversion function
the rad function will convert computed angles from degrees to radians

#Exponential function
Denoted by e on the calculator, this function will find the exponent of the irrational number 2.71828183 powered to any input value

#Logarithmic function
log will compute the Logarithm of a given value to the base 10

#Natural Logarithm
ln will compute the number to which the base(e) has to be raised to equal to a given value

#Fraction function
1/x will return the value of a given number divided by one

#Factorial function
x! will multiply all the natural numbers of a given input smaller than it

#PI
π will compute PI(The circle's circumference ) of a given input.

#Positive/negative sign
± will Assign a negative to a given input

#Equal sign
= will evaluate and compute values of given inputs
